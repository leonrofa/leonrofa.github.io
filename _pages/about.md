Hi! I'm Leon. I received an MSc Statistics and Data Science with a concentration in theoretical statistics from KU Leuven in September 2023. My email is <a href='#'>[first name].[last name]@[googleâ€™s email service].com</a>. You can find my Linkedin profile [here](https://linkedin.com/in/leonrofagha/). 

I provide tutoring for bachelor's-level courses in probability and statistics. I also regularly assist students with statistical analyses and their interpretation. I focus on understanding and provide intuition whenever possible. 

Mathematics didn't come to me naturally initially, and I can therefore empathise with the fact that these topics can sometimes seem overwhelming :-)

I speak French (native), German (native), English (C2), and some Dutch (B1-B2).
